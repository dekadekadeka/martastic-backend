Martastic Backend

Goes along with [Martastic Frontend](https://github.com/dekadekadeka/martastic-frontend). Please get both for the full experience. Honestly, you can't do much with this without the frontend so go get it.

Have a happy Marta day!

TODO:

* Add station and pic likes function (allow anyone, authenticated or not, to rate stations/pics)
* Take index off of friendships
* Take care of keys
* Possible: Tagging feature in pics
